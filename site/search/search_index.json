Mainland and Taiwanese Mandarin are about as similar as British and American English. There is a slight difference in accent, a few different words, and a few different pronunciations, but are mostly the same. Almost all Mainland Chinese dubs are hosted on bilibili, with the exception of some movies and a few shows. Many Taiwanese dubs I've uploaded are from Bahamut. The rest are remuxed or raw recorded TV broadcasts, with mediocre audio quality. I source these mainly from antoc.cn. I have infinite credits on antoc, so contact me if you're interested in a show hosted on this site.</p> <p>Here is a comprehensive list of every anime dubbed into Taiwanese Mandarin.</p> <p>Almost all Mandarin anime dubs are released with matching hard subs, but many are remuxed before I can access them on antoc. When there's a show with hard subs, I usually convert the hard subs into soft subs, then remux the audio and subtitles into a mini encode of the Japanese version to remove the hard subs. Sometimes this requires manually timing every episode, and occasionally requires a lot of work manually splicing audio. Here is the tool I made to help with extracting hard subtitles, along with a tutorial: https://github.com/Furretar/Hardsub-Extract-OCR.</p> <p>All of the subtitles I make are saved at: https://github.com/Furretar/Mandarin-Subtitles-Archive.</p> <p>There is some more information, and another collection of mandarin dubs at  Refold's Mandarin Chinese Anime Donghua Cartoons Index.</p> <p>I'm not learning Cantonese or very interested in Cantonese, so all my Cantonese content is sourced from HulK. You can contact him on the Refold Cantonese Discord server, or on the CantoCaptions discord server.</p>"},{"location":"chinese/mandarin-dubs/#terms","title":"Terms","text":"<ul> <li>SWC - Standard Written Chinese.
