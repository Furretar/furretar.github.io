# Mandarin Dubs
I upload Mandarin dubs of anime at [https://nyaa.si/user/Furretar](https://nyaa.si/user/Furretar). My goal is to optimize my uploads for language learning.

I'm at an intermediate level of Mandarin, with about 6,000 anki cards. I'd love to talk to anyone learning mandarin (or Japanese), so feel free to message me anytime.

## Info
Since Mainland China tends to focus more on domestic media, the majority of Mandarin anime dubs are actually from Taiwan. Mainland and Taiwanese Mandarin are about as similar as British and American English. There is a slight difference in accent, a few different words, and a few different pronunciations, but are mostly the same. Almost all Mainland Chinese dubs are hosted on bilibili, with the exception of some movies and a few shows. Many Taiwanese dubs I've uploaded are from [Bahamut](https://ani.gamer.com.tw/). The rest are remuxed or raw recorded TV broadcasts, with mediocre audio quality. I source these mainly from [antoc.cn](www.antoc.cn/). I have infinite credits on antoc, so contact me if you're interested in a show hosted on this site.

[Here](https://vocustaiwan.fandom.com/zh-tw/wiki/%E5%88%86%E9%A1%9E:%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E5%8B%95%E7%95%AB) is a comprehensive list of every anime dubbed into Taiwanese Mandarin.

Almost all Mandarin anime dubs are released with matching hard subs, but many are remuxed before I can access them on antoc. When there's a show with hard subs, I usually convert the hard subs into soft subs, then remux the audio and subtitles into a [mini encode](https://thewiki.moe/guides/quality/#mini-encode) of the Japanese version to remove the hard subs. Sometimes this requires manually timing every episode, and occasionally requires a lot of work manually splicing audio. Here is the tool I made to help with extracting hard subtitles, along with a tutorial: [https://github.com/Furretar/Hardsub-Extract-OCR](https://github.com/Furretar/Hardsub-Extract-OCR).

All of the subtitles I make are saved at: [https://github.com/Furretar/Mandarin-Subtitles-Archive](https://github.com/Furretar/Mandarin-Subtitles-Archive).

There is some more information, and another collection of mandarin dubs at 
[Refold's Mandarin Chinese Anime Donghua Cartoons Index](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/15ePAgVgzODjoxxaxjTETXiPNlS7Kl6VqzroUJl2HNIU/htmlview#).

I'm not learning Cantonese or very interested in Cantonese, so all my Cantonese content is sourced from HulK. You can contact him on the [Refold Cantonese Discord server](https://refold.la/join/), or on the [CantoCaptions discord server](https://github.com/notHulK11/CantoCaptions).

## Terms
- SWC - Standard Written Chinese. Official Cantonese subtitles don't match exactly what's being spoken, and are basically translated from Cantonese into Mandarin grammar.
- CC - Closed Captions. This means the subtitles match what's being said exactly.
- CHT/CHS - Traditional Chinese/Simplified Chinese. I try to always make Taiwanese dubs have traditional subtitles and make Mainland dubs have simplified subtitles (despite the sources not always matching this).
